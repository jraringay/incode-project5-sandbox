# Sandbox Environment for Testing Purposes

## scripts.js (v2)
### This is a simple search function using ajax jquery ($.getJSON) - Refer to https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies for the proper documentation
### In addition to v1, I made it so that the search results will include the movie's poster image, title, and release date.
```
$(document).ready(function() {
  let api = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie';
  let apiKey = '6c0856c8aca4264172f895e370451731';
  let language = "en-US";

  $('#searchBtn').click(() => {
    let query = $('#searchBar').val() // gets the value of the input text where the title keyword of a movie is typed in
    $('.pagination').empty()
    $('#searchResults').empty().append(
      '<tr>' +
        '<th>Poster</th>' +
        '<th>Title</th>' +
        '<th>Release Date</th>' +
      '</tr>')
    $.getJSON(api + '?api_key=' + apiKey + '&language=' + language + '&query=' + query)
    .done(data => {
      console.log(data) // this is only to see if the API call is working (can be seen in chrome dev tools)
      $.each(data.results, (i, item) => {
        $('#searchResults').append(
          '<tr>' +
            `<td><img id="searchPosterResults" src="https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w600_and_h900_bestv2${item.poster_path}">` +
            '<td>' + item.title + '</td>' +
            '<td>' + item.release_date + '</td>' +
          '</tr>'
        )
        // $('#list').append('<li>' + item.title + '</li>') // See README.md for a (hopefully) comprehensive explanation
      })
      let pages = parseInt(data.total_pages)
      for(let i = 1; i <= pages; i++) {
        $('.pagination').append(
          `<button id="searchResultPage${i}">${i}</button>`
        )
      }
    })
    .fail((jqxhr, textStatus, error) => {
      let err = textStatus + ", " + error
      console.log("Request Failed: " + err)
    })
  })



});
```

### Base the JSON result from v1 for reference

`.empty()` ensures it that every time the script runs, it removes the current instance of the script. Without `.empty()`, every time you make a search, the results stack from the previous search result. 

`https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w600_and_h900_bestv2${item.poster_path}` from `scripts.js line 21` is how we retrieve the poster of a movie and is a result of me tinkering with chrome's dev tools.

```
let pages = parseInt(data.total_pages)
for(let i = 1; i <= pages; i++) {
  $('.pagination').append(
    `<button id="searchResultPage${i}">${i}</button>`
  )
}
```

The above code is what I have conceptualised to address pagination since every instance of the search will only display 20 items from the entire results. The buttons don't do anything at the moment but I will be working on this when I wake up.

## scripts.js (v1)
### This is a simple search function using ajax jquery ($.getJSON) - Refer to https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies for the proper documentation 
```
$(document).ready(function() {
  let api = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie';
  let apiKey = '6c0856c8aca4264172f895e370451731';
  let language = "en-US";

  $('#searchBtn').click(() => {
    let query = $('#searchBar').val() // gets the value of the input text where the title keyword of a movie is typed in
    $.getJSON(api + '?api_key=' + apiKey + '&language=' + language + '&query=' + query)
    .done(data => {
      console.log(data) // this is only to see if the API call is working (can be seen in chrome dev tools)
      $.each(data.results, (i, item) => {
        $('#list').append('<li>' + item.title + '</li>')
      })
    })
  })

});

/* The API call to make search GET request is usually https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=<<api_key>>&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false
* I ommitted &page= and &include_adult= in the query parameters as I think it wont be a big deal with the scope of the project
*/
```

### The JSON result below is when the search string "superman" is used.

The ways to traverse through the JSON given that "data" is the base are the following: 
- to get the page value -> data.page
- to get to the results array -> data.results

But it is necessary to find a way to traverse through the items in the "results" array in order for us to get the necessary data we need.

Normally, we'd access each index by denoting `data.results[0]` and if we want the title, `data.results[0].title`. But doing that manually is inefficient and can potentially give us lines of unnecessary code.

In order for us to simplify that, we use the following codeblock below `$.each` where `i` is the array index number and `item` is the placeholding variable for `data.results`

More info about `.each()` here: https://api.jquery.com/each/#entry-examples

```
$.each(data.results, (i, item) => {
  $('#list').append('<li>' + item.title + '</li>')
})
```

The `append` function there is for testing if the `.each` code block is working by appending `<li>` inside the existing `<ul id="list>`

`item.title` then will return us the title of the movie from that results array indexes.
